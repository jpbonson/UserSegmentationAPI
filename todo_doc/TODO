# TODO

- refactor 'main.rb' code organization/readability according to best practices for ruby + separate into more files + remove code duplication
- separate 'users_list_spec.rb' into more files
- use this: https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop
- use factory to generate objects in the tests (FactoryGirl?)
- more tests for the regex feature to find edge cases
